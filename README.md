# Mutex-Washroom
A synchronous simulation involving twenty coworkers trying to access the washroom at work. The washroom has a max occupancy of three and all users of the washroom must identify as the same gender. A person will try to enter the washroom, and if they are successful, will wait inside for some time before exiting. A fair wait count is used to ensure that both genders will be able to use the washroom within a reasonable time frame. 

Source code in washroom.c, can compile using "make washroom".
